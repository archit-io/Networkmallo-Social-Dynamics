The value of a person is based on the above-mentioned things, but it is just a small part of it.

For example, a good-looking, rich person, who is a CEO of a company, might have very less confidence and hence convey a low value to most of the people around and in turn unable to fully leverage his networking capacity.

Of course, you should work hard for a successful career, but the intent should be for personal satisfaction and not as a way to build a network.
