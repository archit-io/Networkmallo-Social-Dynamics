You would already have added some people to your network. If you're still not comfortable with practice-1, you can take fifteen more days to do so, because if you're not at a certain level of comfort while implementing it, you may not be able to do practice-2. Keep increasing the period of practice-1 by fifteen days at a time, until you feel comfortable enough approaching, interacting, connecting with, and exchanging contact information with complete strangers. This system is not time-bound for the practice-1 stage. Also, note that you will never be completely comfortable approaching and interacting with random people, you just have to be able to develop a certain level of confidence in doing so. Perfection is not required. If in a month, you connected with fifteen people and exchanged contact information with 10 people, you're golden."}),(0,n.jsx)("p",{children:"Now, at this stage, it's time to go live with your practice.
