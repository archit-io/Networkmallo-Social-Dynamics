I would say that in the\xa0whole of these dynamics, grooming just matters 1%. That's it. Period. Don't think about the grooming more than I tell you to. Now, why I am saying so? Just imagine a very dressed person physically fit, smelling great, having a ripped body but still having a slouched posture, unconfident voice, and having lack of self-confidence, and a desperate vibe. Now, imagine another person, 5'6 in height, wearing normal trousers and shirt, wearing specs, having a laid-back confident posture, a great warm smile, and a loud and friendly and confident voice and vibe. Who do you think, would be perceived as of higher value?"}),(0,t.jsx)("p",{children:"Now, why grooming is necessary, even though it's 1%. You would be tempted to think, that it will make you feel confident yourself. A classic mistake. Yes, proper grooming will indeed make you feel 'self-confident' to some extent, but you've to realize that self-confidence that is dependent on your grooming would be fragile and dependent on your clothes and the brand of your perfume. I want you to be confident even when you've not bathed or brushed your teeth, for ten days! Yes, I want that your sense of self is impenetrable by your state of mind, body, or external situation! So, the question still remains unanswered - why is grooming still important? The answer is, that it's a tactic. As simple as that. When you approach someone who doesn't know you, it will take their mind a few seconds (~1 to 10sec) to register your presence and make\xa0a\xa0first impression of you. In a\xa0few seconds, their mind will make an important decision about you. That decision would be - how important you are. And next 30 seconds of their response would be based on that perception. If you make a favorable initial impression, your next 30 seconds will be easy, otherwise, you'll spend those 30 seconds proving that you're not some desperate credit card salesman.
