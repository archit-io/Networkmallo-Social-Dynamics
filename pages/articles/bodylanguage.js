        <h1>Body language</h1>
        <p>This is the most important article for the 'outer development' part. This is what willÂ bring you the results in terms of outer skills. These are the absolute basics and the massive pillars on which this system stands. If you violate any of these principles, your communication and sub-communication will crumble in a moment. If don't do these things consistently your results will crumble in no time.</p>

        <h2>Voice</h2>
        <h3>If you're a man</h3>
        <p>Get ready for the shock. When you're talking your voice should be loud! Not like the one when you shout, but a naturally loud voice. How much loud? It depends. If you think and people have told you that your voice is really meek, you should aim at being five to seven times louder than you speak. To you, that would sound like you're shouting at the person in front of you, but to the other person, it will sound normal and even high value. If you have a normally loud voice, you still should aim at being 3 to 4 times louder than you are.</p>
        <p>Starting from today, do the following exercise once everyday.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Find a secluded place either at your home or outside with a ten meter gap in front of you</li>
            <li>It would be great if you have a pillar or a wall or any object at that distance</li>
            <li>Now talk to it for 10-15 minutes loudly</li>
            <li>Don't care about what other think about you</li>
            <li>This task is difficult since a few people may invariably observe you, but trust the process and do it</li>
            <li>Starting from today, do it every day for five days</li>
            <li>After a few days find a busy public place (like a road) where no one would recognize you and do the above task for another five days</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once you start doing it, you'll find that, once you speak in a loud voice, you feel confident. This happens because your mental state is affected by your physiology. This is the confidence you want and that conveys high value to other people. Tell me how many high-value people like celebs, generals, politicians, etc have you seen speaking in a low voice. Most of them have a commanding voice. That's the kind of voice that you want to have. However, be cautious that this advice is not meant to make you sound like a jerk. There is one more component that would be added that would help you not sound like a jerk while you're loud. The magic of a loud voice can only be experienced once you do the exercise above. But don't talk to the others in a loud voice yet. I'll tell you when and how to interact with others using this system.</p>
        <h3>If you're a woman</h3>
        <p>Loudness doesn't matter too much for you. You should be loud enough to be comfortably heard by a person sitting across a large table in a crowded place. So, you too can do the above practice. Just don't go to a too secluded place or you can practice at home.</p>

        <h2>Smile</h2>
        <p>Whenever you approach someone to initiate a conversation, smile. It should be a heartfelt and genuine smile. People should feel that you're a naturally social and friendly person. Also, since you would be somewhat louder than the other people in the environment it would be better to smile, or else you may sound arrogant. If the smile is not coming out genuinely at the moment, just fake it! With practice, you'll be able to smile naturally. Currently, there is no exercise related to this, but just add this principle to your Anki and internalize it.</p>

        <h2>Eye contact</h2>
        <p>Maintain eye contact with the person you're talking to. It takes practice and is uncomfortable at the first, but it is important. Also, if you already have a habit of maintaining strong eye contact don't overdo it, or you'll look like a creep. The point is you should be able to maintain eye contact comfortably for as long as you want, but if you're not engaged in a deep conversation it is advisable to occasionally break the eye contact in like 15 seconds or so. You'll get hold of it after a few weeks of practice. Till then don't be afraid of making mistakes.</p>
        <p>As an exercise, every day either turn on the selfie video recorder on your phone or stand in front of a mirror and look in your own eye for 5 minutes straight. Do this every day for the next fifteen days.</p>

        <h2>Lean Back</h2>
        <p>Lean back. Don't have hunched shoulders. It will feel uncomfortable at first as with all other things, but once you realize its importance, you'll tend to lean back naturally. Also, if you're talking to someone who is sitting down while you're standing, you may have a tendency to lean forward. Don't. Just lean back.</p>
